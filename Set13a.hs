-- Ex 1: Your task is to help implement the function readName that

--   2. one of the names contains numbers
--   3. one of the names doesn't start with a capital letter
--
-- The function readNames has already been implemented using the ?>
-- operator from the course material. You need to define the helper
-- functions split, checkNumber and checkCapitals so that readNames
-- works correctly.

(?>) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b

-- "a b c", but you don't need to worry about those here)

-- Ex 7: using the State monad, write the operation `update` that first
-- multiplies the state by 2 and then adds one to it. The state has
-- type Int.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Ex 8: Checking that parentheses are balanced with the State monad.
--
-- Do this by implementing the function paren, which updates the state
-- based on a single character. A '(' should increase the state, and a
-- ')' should decrease the state. If the state goes to -1 (there are
-- more closing than opening parentheses), it should stay there to
-- indicate that a parenthesis error was encountered.
--
-- After you've implemented paren, the given definition of parensMatch
-- should work.
--
-- Examples:
--   runState (paren '(') 3    ==> ((),4)
--   runState (paren ')') 3    ==> ((),2)
--   runState (paren ')') 0    ==> ((),-1)
--   runState (paren ')') (-1) ==> ((),-1)

-- Ex 9: using a state of type [(a,Int)] we can keep track of the
-- numbers of occurrences of elements of type a. For instance
-- [('a',1),('x',3)] means that we've seen one 'a' and three 'x's.
--
-- Implement a State monad operation count that registers the
-- occurrence of the given value.
--
-- That is, the operation `count x` should fetch the pair `(x,n)` from
-- the state, and replace it with the pair `(x,n+1)`. If no such pair
-- is found, the operation should add `(x,1)` to the state.
--
-- Examples:
--  runState (count True) []
--    ==> ((),[(True,1)])
--  runState (count 7) []
--    ==> ((),[(7,1)])
--  runState (count 'a') [('a',1),('b',3)]
--    ==> ((),[('a',2),('b',3)])
--  runState (count 'a' >> count 'b' >> count 'a') []

-- Ex 10: Implement the operation occurrences, which

--
-- In other words, use the state monad to count how many unique values
